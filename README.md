## React

#### Components

Everything in React is a component, and these usually take the form of JavaScript classes.

Starting with `React.Component`, the `render` method returns a description of what you want to see on the screen, returning a `React element`, which is a lightweight description of what to render.

### JSX

React developers use a syntax called `JSX` which makes these structures easier. For example,  the ` <div />` syntax is transformed at build time to `React.createElement('div')`. You can put any JavaScript expressions within braces inside JSX!

#### Data

There are two types of data in React:

* state: private and can be changed from within the component itself.
* props: external, and not controlled by the component itself.

A component can change its internal state directly but it can not change its props directly.



### Tutorials

#### React in 5 minutes with create-react-app

1. Install Node.js and Yarn.

```
$ brew install node
$ brew install yarn
```

2. Install [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). This awesome framework abstracts away all the complexity of implementing [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), [Babel](https://babeljs.io/), a dev server, a production build process, and other critical things.

3. Create Your App

```
$ yarn create react-app <your-app-name>
```

 4. Run it!

```
$ cd <your-app-name>
$ yarn start
```

5. You now have your app running at `http://localhost:3000/ `! The components of your app are the following:

* `node_modules`: holds all the third-party code, such as React.
* `public`: where our static assets go, like our favicon. It also keeps the project's HTML file. Because React is all JavaScript, you only really need the HTML file to update the <head> (title and meta tags).
* `src` is where our application actually lives. Iâ€™d recommend exploring all these files, to get a sense of how they work together.

6. Go to `src` and edit `src/App.js` to add things you want React to render:

```
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import logo from './logo.svg';
import './App.css';

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <header className="App-header">
          <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
          <h1 className="App-title">Welcome to React</h1>
        </header>
        <p className="App-intro">
          HELLO THERE!
          <code>src/App.js</code> and save to reload.
        </p>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

You will see the additions instantly updated in your browser at `http://localhost:3000/ `.
