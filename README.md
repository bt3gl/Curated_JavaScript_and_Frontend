# ðŸ¦„ Everything React ðŸ¦„ 

A repository with everything you need to learn and become an expert on [React](https://reactjs.org/). It goes together with a series of posts I am starting at [my blog](http://singularity.sh/).

***This is still in construction so Stay Tuned! <3***



## Tutorials

### React in 5 minutes

1. Install Node.js and Yarn.

```
$ brew install node
$ brew install yarn
```

2. Install [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). This awesome framework abstracts away all the complexity of implementing [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), [Babel](https://babeljs.io/), a dev server, a production build process, and other critical things.

3. Create Your App

```
$ yarn create react-app <your-app-name>
```

 4. Run it!

```
$ cd <your-app-name>
$ yarn start
```

5. Edit `src/App.js` and see it being update instantly in your browser at `http://localhost:3000/ `. The directory structure is the following:

    * `node_modules`: holds all the third-party code, such as React.
    * `public`: where our static assets go, like our favicon. It also keeps the project's HTML file. Because React is all JavaScript, you only really need the HTML file to update the <head> (title and meta tags).
    * `src` is where our application actually lives. Iâ€™d recommend exploring all these files, to get a sense of how they work together.
